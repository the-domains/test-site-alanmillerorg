            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>2016 heralds beginning of the "megatall" skyscraper era</h1><p>The number of skyscrapers over 600 metres high - known as "megatalls" - is set to more than double in the next few years, say experts. Skyscraper authority the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH) has revealed that the number of 600-metre-plus buildings in the world is set to rise from three to seven in the next five years.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/6dc254f102a656394610b9763b92e10cf71a534a.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Light painting with pixelstick</h1><p>More info at thepixelstick.com! We spent the last year building pixelstick, a light painting tool capable of everything from photo-real renders to amazing abstract ribbons. We've improved with every iteration and are excited to finally show off what it can do. Everything was shot by just two slightly sleep deprived guys and one Pixelstick in Brooklyn.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/5080ae11f6ad71390eca523c2eba50c17928b5da.jpg"></article>]]></description>
